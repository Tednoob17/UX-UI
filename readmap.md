# UX-UI Hero Roadmap

This roadmap organizes the entire UX-UI curriculum into a clear, repeatable path.

## How the program is structured

- UX Quests 1-7 (research -> define -> prototype -> test)
- UI Quests 1-5 (visual foundations -> systems -> rules -> interface -> heuristics)
- Projects 1-4 (each has UX + UI parts)

## Prerequisites and rules

- Use Figma as your main tool.
- Document everything and keep a clean visual style.
- Export deliverables as required (PDF or Figma file) and push to GitHub.
- Use the naming convention: Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber.
- Projects require testing with at least 5 people and a presentation to at least 5 people.

## Weekly workflow (repeatable)

1. Read the exercise README.
2. Do the work in Figma or write the PDF.
3. Export and name the deliverable properly.
4. Push to GitHub.
5. Write a short reflection (goal, what you did, what you learned, next step).

## Estimated completion if you study 4-5 hours per day (7 days/week)

At this pace, a realistic finish is about 16 weeks (projects have a minimum of 2 weeks each).
Start date: Feb 12, 2026. Estimated finish: Jun 3, 2026.

Note: If you can schedule testing and presentations faster, you can shrink the buffer.

## Progress intranet (tiny tracker)

Location: [intranet/index.html](intranet/index.html)

Default login is stored in [intranet/users.json](intranet/users.json):

- Username: hero
- Password: uxui123

How to run:

1. Start a local server from the repo root: `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Open `http://localhost:8000/intranet/index.html` in your browser.
3. Log in and check tasks as you finish them. Progress is saved in your browser.

## Portfolio strategy

- Each quest becomes one short case study (problem, process, key outputs, learnings).
- Each project becomes a full case study (research, concept, prototype, testing, iteration).
- Save screenshots of every stage, not just final screens.

## Start here

1. Open UX Quest 1 and complete the first exercise: user interviews.
2. Create your first deliverable and push it to GitHub.
3. Move to the next exercise only after the previous deliverable is complete.
